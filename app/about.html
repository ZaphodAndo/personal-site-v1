                <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi 👋 I’m Ethan, an apprentice applications developer who works for a company called PebblePad.
                </p>
                <p class="middle">
                    I am mostly a Frontend dev that occasionally delves into a bit of backend and other areas especially at my place of work where I use a lot of C# and .NET alongside your usual frontend technologies such as JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main interests are in Frontend web development however I also have a great interest in mobile development, an area which I am currently looking to maybe expand my knowledge into.
                </p>
                <h2>What is this site about ?</h2>
                <p>
                    This site is my little corner of the internet where I will be posting things that I have learned over time in my adventures as a software developer as well as potential tutorials and guides on various things software and programming related and maybe even the occasional general blog post that will probably mostly involve me incessantly ranting about something going on or involved with the tech industry as a whole.
                </p>
                <p class="last">
